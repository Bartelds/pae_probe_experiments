Running experiments using wav2vec 2.0 features
==============================================
Instructions
-------------
- Representations are automatically computed for each of the transformer layers (edit layer variable in ``run.sh`` to change this).
- Representations are evaluated using the phone classification task utilizing the standard TIMIT to shorten runtime.
- Run ``run.sh``.
